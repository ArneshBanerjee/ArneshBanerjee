## 🚀 Ongoing Research
1. **Reoccurance of Breast Cancer**
   - Using Machine Learning to Predict the reoccurance of Breast Cancer under the guidance of Prof. Aprita Talukdar, HITK.

## 🚀 Projects

1. **Candidate Smart Profile Competency Score Calculator**:  
   - Built for **SIH 2024**, worked solo on this project which led my team to Round 2.
   - Utilizes **ML (Scikit-Learn)** with **Random Forest** to predict a user's job category by analyzing their resume.
   - Recommends **courses and jobs** based on the candidate's skill set to help them improve.
   - Private repo (still in progress).

2. **Seismic Detection Across the Solar System**:  
   - Developed **machine learning models using NASA-provided seismic data** from the Apollo missions and Mars InSight Lander to distinguish seismic quakes from noise.
   - Achieved 86.67% accuracy in classifying signals, optimizing data transmission for planetary seismology missions.
   - Utilized Python, Keras, Scikit Learn, ARIMA models, and Jupyter Notebook
  
## 🚀 Enterprenurship

1. **Video to Notes Generation Web Based Application:**
   - Auto mp4 to notes conversion
   - Features for disabled(blind) students.
   - Pitched at an Enterprenurship Event at my Uni and got place in **Top 10** in my Freshman Year.
   - Currently Under developement.
