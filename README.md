## 🚀 Projects

1. **Candidate Smart Profile Competency Score Calculator**:  
   - Built for **SIH 2024**, worked solo on this project which led my team to Round 2.
   - Utilizes **ML (Scikit-Learn)** with **Random Forest** to predict a user's job category by analyzing their resume.
   - Recommends **courses and jobs** based on the candidate's skill set to help them improve.
   - Private repo (still in progress).

2. **Seismic Detection Across the Solar System**:  
   - Developed **machine learning models using NASA-provided seismic data** from the Apollo missions and Mars InSight Lander to distinguish seismic quakes from noise
   - Achieved 86.67% accuracy in classifying signals, optimizing data transmission for planetary seismology missions.
   - Utilized Python, Keras, Scikit Learn, ARIMA models, and Jupyter Notebook

3. **Wheat Disease Detection**
   - Developed a full-stack web application using Flask (Python) for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend, featuring a **machine learning model built with the ResNet50 architecture** for wheat disease detection through image classification
   - Integrated the Gemini API to provide detailed diagnoses, symptoms, concerns, and management strategies for detected diseases, including recommendations for cultural, chemical, and biological control methods
